# Dwira — AI interior design (Android · iOS · Web)

One Expo codebase (SDK 57, Expo Router, TypeScript, NativeWind, Zustand, i18next, Reanimated).
Hybrid app: content repositories retain their existing mock/local implementation. User sessions, credits, image spaces, requests and admin notifications use the Postgres-backed API in `server/` (served on Vercel through `api/index.js`).

## Android app (APK)
Download the latest APK from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/elqaddaoui/interior-design-app-ui/releases/latest)**.
**Every update is released as a new version:** after merging into `main`, push a tag `vX.Y.Z` (or Actions → *Android release* → *Run workflow*); the workflow builds the signed APK and publishes the release. One-time setup (move the workflow file into `.github/workflows/`, signing key): [`docs/ANDROID_RELEASES.md`](docs/ANDROID_RELEASES.md).

## Run
```bash
npm install
npx expo start        # then press a (Android) / i (iOS) / w (web)
npm run web           # web only (responsive: centred layout, desktop top nav)
npm run typecheck
npm run build:web     # static export to dist/ (+ Vercel-safe asset post-processing)
npm run serve:web     # serve dist/ locally with the same SPA fallback as Vercel
npm run check:themes  # WCAG contrast report for the 20 theme presets
```
- User app: `/` · Admin panel: `/admin`. Default login everywhere (real and demo mode): user `admin` / password `admin`. Custom server credentials (`ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`) also work in addition.
- Languages: Moroccan Darija (default, RTL), Arabic (RTL), French — Settings → Language.
- Admin edits write to the same Zustand store the user app reads, so they apply instantly.

## Architecture
```
src/
  app/            Expo Router routes ((tabs), tool, render, lead, result, explore, chat, settings, pro, admin/*)
  components/     ui/ (Card, MediaView, StepHeader, GridSelector, Sheet…), wizard/, result/, admin/ (CrudTable, FormModal…)
  admin/entities  ONE config per CRUD entity -> one generic CrudScreen
  data/types.ts   domain model (LText = {dar, ar, fr})
  data/repositories/{types,index}.ts   interfaces + composition root (the ONLY file to change for a backend)
  data/mock/      in-memory + AsyncStorage implementations, seed data, mock services
  store/ theme/ i18n/ hooks/ lib/
```

## Data: everything lives in the database
With the backend enabled (default on web, or `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` on native) the app keeps **no local copy** of business data. `src/data/repositories/index.ts` wires every repository to the API:

| Data | Table(s) | Who writes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content: `tabs`, `tools`, `roomTypes`, `styles`, `palettes`, `sections`, `categories`, `inspirations`, `models`, `plans` | `content_items` | admin (`PUT/DELETE /api/admin/content/...`) |
| Settings documents: `branding`, `theme`, `assistant`, `settings` | `content_docs` | admin (`PATCH /api/admin/doc/:name`) |
| Clients (leads), credits, blocked state | `clients` | clients sign in; admin edits credits/blocked |
| Render requests | `requests` | clients create; admin updates |
| Per-client history and chats | `space` | the client |
| Notification / banner / language preferences | `clients.prefs` (clients), `admin_prefs` (admins) | the person, from any device |
| Push devices | `subscriptions` (owner = admin id or client id) | the person, per device |

The starter content in `server/seed-content.json` (generated from `src/data/mock/seed.ts` with `npm run gen:seed`) is inserted **once** into an empty database (`content_seeded` marker); after that edits and deletions are permanent. Provider API keys are only returned to admin sessions. Only truly device-local values stay on the device: the anonymous device token, the "admin session exists" flag, and in-progress UI state. `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_MODE=demo` restores the old AsyncStorage mocks for offline demos only.

### Real-time sync
`GET /api/sync` returns a version counter per kind of data (`content`, `requests`, `clients`, one per client, one per admin). Every device polls it every 4 s (and on focus/visibility/reconnect) and reloads only what changed: admin edits appear on all admin and client devices, new leads/requests appear on every admin device, credits/blocks/history reach the owning client on all of their devices. Unsaved admin drafts are never overwritten. (Websockets are not available on Vercel serverless; polling is the portable real-time channel. The same poll also retries failed notifications.)

### Uploaded images
All media (admin images and videos, client photos, AI results, chat images, external image links) is stored in **Cloudflare R2** through `server/media.js` and referenced by stable `/api/media/<hash>.<ext>` URLs (a redirect to the public R2 object). Videos use admin-only presigned uploads; external https images are downloaded once. Without the `R2_*` variables, files fall back to raw bytes in the `media` table; base64 is never stored. Setup and migration (`scripts/migrate-media-to-r2.js`): see [docs/r2-setup.md](docs/r2-setup.md).

## Services to replace later (`Services`)
`render` (AI image generation), `chat` (assistant LLM), `upload` (file storage), `whatsapp` (send design) are still mock services; `auth` is the real admin login.

## Deploy on Vercel (UI + API)
`vercel.json` builds the static web export **and** exposes the backend as a Vercel Function (`api/index.js` -> `server/index.js`). The backend needs a Postgres database; without one every `/api/*` call answers `503 DATABASE_NOT_CONFIGURED` and `/lead` shows "service temporairement indisponible".
1. Import the repo in Vercel (framework preset: **Other**); install/build/output are set in `vercel.json`.
2. **Project -> Storage -> Create Database -> Neon (Postgres)** and connect it to the project (Production + Preview). Vercel injects `DATABASE_URL` / `POSTGRES_URL`; tables are created automatically on first request.
3. Redeploy, then open `https://<your-domain>/api/health`: it must return `{"ok":true,"database":"pg",...}`. Then test `/lead`.
4. Admin login at `/admin`: `admin` / `admin` by default. For real credentials set `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (`ADMIN_PASSWORD='...' node server/password.js`) and then `DISABLE_DEFAULT_ADMIN=true`.
5. Optional environment variables: `CRON_SECRET` (protects `/api/push/pump`), `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` (otherwise generated and stored in the database), `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (native Android app). See `server/.env.example`.
6. Node 22.13+ is required (`engines` in `package.json`).

### Performance (first load)
What keeps the first load fast, and where to change it:
- **The UI never waits for the network.** Home renders as soon as the device-only reads (language, local flags) are done. Public content comes from, in order: the HTML shell's early request (`scripts/postexport.js` injects a `fetch('/api/content')` that starts before the JavaScript has downloaded), the copy cached on the device (`dwira:v1:content-cache`, public content only, never an admin copy), then the network. With nothing cached, Home shows same-size placeholders (never a false "empty" message). The session check runs in the background. Startup reads retry at most 4 times (0.8 s, 1.6 s, 2.4 s) and then the app stays open; the 4 s sync loop keeps trying.
- **API.** `vercel.json` pins the function to `fra1` (next to the Neon database in Frankfurt). `/api/health` and the public `/api/content` skip the session/auth lookup (an admin credential or `?a=1` is the only thing that triggers it). Tables are created only when the stored schema marker (`settings.schema_version`, a hash of the schema) differs, not on every cold start.
- **`/api/content` caching.** Public responses carry `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, s-maxage=<CONTENT_S_MAXAGE>, stale-while-revalidate=<10x>`; `CONTENT_S_MAXAGE` defaults to 30 seconds, is capped at 300 and `0` disables shared caching. Admin requests (`?a=1`, or any credential) are always `private, no-store`: that copy contains provider API keys. After an admin edit, devices reload with `?v=<version>` so the short CDN window never delays a change they were told about.
- **Bundle.** The gesture library (before/after slider, admin drag handle) is an on-demand chunk; the web gesture root no longer imports it. The Home route chunks are preloaded from the shell. Unused packages were removed.
- **Assets.** The web icon font is subset to the glyphs the app can use (`python3 scripts/subset-icons.py`, needs `fonttools` + `brotli`; re-run it if you add icons to `ICON_CHOICES` or the seed). The first Home card image is `fetchpriority=high`/eager and preloaded by the shell once the content names it. Hashed files under `/_expo` and `/assets` are immutable for a year; icons/favicon are cached for 30 days, the manifest for a day, `index.html` always revalidates (same policy in `vercel.json` and the Node server).
- **Measure it.** `node scripts/measure-lcp.js <url> --runs=5 [--images=allow] [--cpu=4]` runs a cold-cache load on emulated Slow-4G (1.6 Mbit/s, 150 ms RTT) and prints LCP/FCP/bytes. It is a lab figure from your machine; use PageSpeed Insights for the real one.

### Notifications
- **Admins** get a push for every **new lead** (a client signing up) and every **new render request**, on every device where notifications are enabled. Open `/admin` -> **Activer les notifications** then **Envoyer un test**.
- **Clients** get a push when their design is **ready** (the admin marks the request delivered), on every device where they enabled notifications.
- **On by default:** whenever a device already has notification permission and the person's saved setting (stored in the database, per admin / per client) is not "off", the device is subscribed silently on sign-in or startup, with no prompt. Turning notifications off in Settings is saved in the database and applies to all of that person's devices. The browser/OS permission prompt can only be shown from a tap, so first-time opt-in is the toggle in Settings or the banner in History.
- Works on desktop Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari, Android Chrome, and the Android app. On iPhone/iPad, first use Safari **Share -> Add to Home Screen**, open Dwira from that icon, then enable notifications (Apple only allows web push for installed web apps).
- Delivery is sent from the API request itself (bounded wait); failures stay in the outbox and are retried by the sync poll and the daily cron (`/api/push/pump`, Vercel Hobby allows daily crons only).

Why `scripts/postexport.js`? Vercel never serves paths containing a `node_modules` segment, but `expo export` writes package fonts/images
(icon font, router icons) to `dist/assets/node_modules/...`. The script moves them to `dist/assets/vendor/...` and rewrites all references, injects the web app manifest/iOS meta tags, and fails the build if any are left.

## Admin: interface options
- **Loading screen** (`/admin/interface`): on/off, 4 built-in styles (ring, dots, pulse, bars) + a custom image (GIF/SVG/PNG/WebP, optional spin/pulse), colour, and display time. **Auto** (default) removes it as soon as the first two Home cards have painted; a fixed time (0.5-10 s) keeps it that long after opening. The same loader is shown whatever page the app opens on, and every in-app spinner (buttons, loading placeholders, large images) uses it too (`<Spinner/>`). On web it is plain HTML/SVG in `index.html` (painted before any JavaScript, see `src/lib/loaderShell.js`); native draws the same styles in React (`BootOverlay`).
- **Dashboard**: 7/30/90-day KPIs with trend vs the previous period, activity chart, search (requests, users, tools, styles, rooms), best features, recent activity, quick actions.
- **Interface & menus** (`/admin/interface`): choose the user bottom bar (Classic / Floating / Minimal) and the admin menu (icon rail / collapsible drawer / grouped horizontal menu). Stored in `settings.userNavStyle` / `settings.adminNavMode`.
- **Home tabs** (`/admin/tabs`): switch "show all tools by default" (`settings.homeShowAll`). When on, Home opens on an "All" pill and tabs are an optional filter.
- **Theme** (`/admin/theme`): 20 presets in 6 categories + custom (5 colours, the rest derived with contrast checks). The phone status bar and Android navigation bar take the theme background colour (`SystemBars`).
- The AI model is chosen by the admin per tool (default model fallback); end users never see a model picker.

## Local full stack
```bash
npm run build:web
PGLITE_DIR=:memory: COOKIE_SECURE=false npm run start:server   # API + dist on http://localhost:8080 (in-process Postgres, no install)
```
Without `PGLITE_DIR`, data is stored in `server/data/pglite`. Set `DATABASE_URL` to use a real Postgres instead. `/api/health` returns JSON with `ok`, `runtime`, `database` and `adminConfigured`; HTML means `/api` routing is wrong. For a separately hosted API, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api-host/api` **before building** (required for Android/iOS) and `APP_ORIGINS` on the backend. To intentionally run the UI-only demo, build with `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_MODE=demo`.

### Checks
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:server        # backend (in-memory Postgres), push, config
# with the local full stack running (use API_RATE_LIMIT=5000):
node scripts/check-client-browser.js   # lead flow, sessions, admin menu
node scripts/check-push-browser.js     # notification button desktop/mobile/iOS hint
node scripts/check-sync-browser.js     # two browsers: content, leads and preferences sync (server serving dist/)
```
Phone-only login is the existing behavior (no OTP verification); do not treat knowledge of a phone number as production-grade proof of identity. Real push delivery to Google/Apple and physical devices remain manual checks.
